# CS207

Project to for a control panel to control and display output from computer software, mainly video games.

## Installation

A similar project using the 74HC595 and Arduino Uno could be made with slight modifications to this code. I may build another one of these with a different layout in the future and at that point I would modify the code to be more modular and work with almost any configuration.

## Usage

1. Flash code to the Arduino
2. Run the ControlPanel python script
3. Launch a game
4. If it does not have a source then configure your controls

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request
