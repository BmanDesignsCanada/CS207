	\section{Introduction}
		\paragraph{}
		This project's goal was to create a control panel that would be connected to a computer and used as a standard game pad, allowing for compatibility with any game. Some games would be modified to allow the data to be sent back to the game pad to be displayed; This would set it aside from most similar projects, almost all controllers are solely for input and most maker projects for video games focus on output. This project's goal was to combine both for a better experience for the user.
	\section{Inspiration}
		\paragraph{}
		The inspiration for this project came from other makers who had created and shared their similar projects. Most of the projects I used for my inspiration had only targeted one game, mainly \gls{KSP}. The projects I saw mostly consisted of only outputs and displays, only a few featuring a small number of buttons. I wanted to take the information the previous makers had posted and use it to design a panel that consisted of both output and input and allow for the input to be used in any game.
	\section{Design Process}
		\subsection{Hardware}
			\paragraph{}
			The largest hurdle during the beginning of the design process of the panel itself was finding the rest size of the panel to accommodate all the parts originally planned. It needed to be large enough to hold comfortably all the parts without being too large to use on a desk in front of a monitor. In the end fancier displays like an \gls{LCD}, seven segment displays, and dials all had to be cut from the original plans for this project to fit all everything onto the panel without sacrificing the final usability of the game pad.
			\paragraph{}
			The construction of the enclosure was designed both for a wood based construction and 3D printed models. Wood was chosen as the building material for its sturdiness, low cost and smaller construction time allowing for a higher margin of error. A 3D printed enclosure would take too long to reprint in the event of a design change or error in printing.

		\subsubsection{Buttons \& \glspl{LED}}
			\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.3\textwidth}
				\vspace*{-0.5cm}
    			\centering
    			\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{button}
    			\caption{LED Button}
    			\label{fig:button}
			\end{wrapfigure}
			\paragraph{}
			The primary form of output on the control panel is \glspl{LED}. Some of these \glspl{LED} are built into the buttons (fig.~\ref{fig:button}) on the control panel to create a clear sense of the severity of an action. If an action is dangerous and  permanent (separating boosters in a space game) then the button for that action would be flashing red. A safe action (looking at your map) would be a solid green button. This is to prevent accidental button pushes. If you are flying an airplane and want to view your map; you do not want to push the eject button accidentally.
			\paragraph{}
			Every \gls{LED} on the panel is individually addressable and has \gls{PWM} capability.  Unlike standard \gls{PWM} which uses a 256 point scale (providing 16.8 million colors),the \gls{PWM} created for this panel uses a 32 point scale (32 thousand colors); this is to allow for a faster overall experience at the cost of accuracy of colors. Every \gls{LED} also has it is own state machine allowing the \glspl{LED} to act completely independent of each other. They can flash or fade at different rates, be linked to in-game information and have complete color control.
			\paragraph{}
			\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}
    			\centering
    			\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{toggle}
    			\caption{Toggle}
    			\label{fig:toggle}
			\end{wrapfigure}
			Along side the buttons is a large toggle switch (fig.~\ref{fig:toggle}). The toggle switch is used to enable the use of the red buttons. When the switch is in the off position, the buttons disable in the Arduino's code, preventing their accidental usage before or after they are needed. Pushing the eject button, launching a spacecraft, disengaging primary engines and other potentially irreversible actions would all be mapped to these red buttons that require the toggle switch to be activated.

		\subsubsection{RGB \glspl{LED}}
			\paragraph{}
			Along the top of the panel, a row of \gls{RGB} \glspl{LED} were placed. These allow for information to be displayed in a simple and concise manner. For example, in a space game, a \gls{LED} could be mapped to altitude changes. If your craft's altitude is not changing the \gls{LED} would be green, small changes in altitude would be yellow, larger changes would be red, and plummeting towards the surface would be flashing red. This system allows for quick recognition of problems that \gls{LCD} displays are unable to provide. Multiple flashing red \glspl{LED} provide a much more obvious "something is wrong" indicator compared to numbers on displays.
		\subsubsection{Joystick}
			\paragraph{}
			\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.24\textwidth}
				\vspace*{-1cm}
    			\centering
    			\includegraphics[width=0.24\textwidth]{joystick}
    			\caption{Joystick}
    			\label{fig:joystick}
			\end{wrapfigure}
			The control panel features a 3-axis joystick (fig.~\ref{fig:joystick}) with a single button located on the top. The joystick that was selected is small compared to many retail video game joysticks. The joystick only requires your thumb and index finger to use allowing for slow, fine movements. The primary purpose of the joystick is to control the docking procedure in \gls{KSP}, but it is compatible with any game that has support for a flight stick.
		\subsection{Software}
			\subsubsection{Arduino}
				\paragraph{}
				The code on the Arduino communicates with the computer software over an \gls{API} running on the serial connection. The Arduino responds to commands received over the serial connection. The commands are used to control the \glspl{LED} or any other output that may be added in the future. The Arduino is constantly sending the joystick's position to the computer to provide smooth motion in the game. Button commands are only sent when a button is pushed down or released. A status \gls{LED} on the Arduino lets the user see if a connection has been made to the software running on the computer and lets developers know when the Arduino is safe for flashing.
			\subsubsection{Computer}
				\paragraph{}
				The software on the computer communicates with the Arduino over a serial connection. The software can send \gls{LED} commands and receives button and joystick information from the Arduino. These are then emulated on the computer as if the events came from a proper \gls{HID} joystick. The Arduino does not register on the computer as a \gls{HID} game pad as that would not allow for information to be sent to the Arduino over a serial port, eliminating the ability to display in-game information on the panel.
				\paragraph{}
				The control software on the computer hosts a \gls{TCP} socket server allowing games with modifications installed to communicate with the software. The modifications for games are called sources. The sources collect information from the game and send commands to the control software. This allows the Arduino to display information from the game the user is playing. The source can also change key bindings for the software. Instead of the user mapping controls manually the source can tell the software what to make each button do.

	\section{Build Process}
		\paragraph{}
			The bottom, front, and back of the panel are built from \(\frac{3}{4}\)  inch wood; the top of the panel with the components is made from thin particle board. The panel has 5x14 inches of usable space. Holes were drilled in the particle board for each component.

		\subsection{Hardware}
			\subsubsection{Shift Registers}
				\paragraph{}
					\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{0.35\textwidth}
					\vspace*{-0.5cm}
    				\centering
    				\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{registers}
    				\caption{Shift Registers}
    				\label{fig:circuit}
					\end{wrapfigure}
					The most important component of the electrical circuit in the panel is the ten 8-bit shift registers. The registers are daisy chained together, essentially creating one 80-bit register. This is what allows this project to have so many digital inputs and outputs (fifty-six outputs \& fourteen inputs) even though the Arduino Uno used only has fourteen digital pins. There are ten unused pins on the shift registers allowing for future expansion. The panel only requires three outputs (data, clock, latch) and one input (buttons).
			\subsubsection{Buttons}
				\paragraph{}
					The panel features twelve buttons and a toggle switch but only uses one digital input on the Arduino. The is accomplished by connecting the reference voltage of the buttons to the shift register instead of to a five volt source. Only one button is provided with a reference voltage at any given time; if the reference voltage is detected by the Arduino then the Arduino knows that button is pressed.

				\end{tikzpicture}
				\label{fig:diagram}
				\caption{Flow Diagram}
			\end{figure}
			\subsubsection{Arduino}
				\paragraph{}
					The Arduino software is programmed with C++ and uses the \gls{GCC} compiler as part of the Platformio ecosystem. Some non-standard C++ code is used and the \gls{GCC} or similar compiler is required. No makefile is provided and compiling with Platformio's tools is the best method.
				\paragraph{}
					The Arduino code is heavily dependent on the many state machines that have been created for each component type. These state machines allow all components to work independently of each other. The state machines tick in an order that allows the input to be recorded and sent to the computer without noticeable delay and the \glspl{LED} can flash fast enough that no flickering is visible.
			\subsubsection{Linux}
				\paragraph{}
					The control software for Linux is written in Python. Python was chosen as it allows quick development and testing as well as having a well documented Serial library. uinput, a kernel module for Linux, is used to emulate a joystick. The Python library python-uinput is used to interface with the kernel module. The Python program receives joystick positions and button presses from the Arduino and then emulates those same actions on the computer.
			\subsubsection{Windows}
				\paragraph{}
					The control software for Windows is not functional at the time of this report. The software is being created using C++ and the vJoy device driver. vJoy is used to simulate a joystick when one is not available but the software being used requires one. The control software will use vJoy to turn the information from the Arduino into a simulated joystick.
			\subsubsection{Game Modifications (Sources)}
				\paragraph{}
					Modifications for games that interact with the control software are called sources. They provide information that can be displayed on the panel's \glspl{LED} as well as tell the software how to map the buttons.
				\paragraph{\gls{KSP}}
					The \gls{KSP} source is written in C\#. The source sends spaceship status information to the control software to be displayed on the Arduino. It maps the buttons to actions based on their severity. The buttons are in three colors: red, blue and green. The \gls{KSP} source uses red for irreversible actions, blue for potentially irreversible and green for safe. The \gls{RGB} \glspl{LED} are used to display the status of various components as well as flight details.
				\paragraph{Arma 3}
					The Arma 3 source is written in C for the Linux version and C\# for Windows. Arma 3 is a military simulator with infantry, land vehicles and air vehicles. The source primarily focuses on helicopters although it can work on airplanes. The source uses the joystick to control the helicopter and uses the buttons to control doors, landing gear, trim and other aspects of the helicopter's flight. The \gls{RGB} \glspl{LED} are used to display the status of critical components and can flash or change color when a problem is detected. (Rotor damage, engine stall, etc.)
				\paragraph{Future Sources}
					The sources do not require any code changes to the control software or the Arduino. This allows any sources to be created in the future without a single change required to any of the existing code. The control software uses \gls{TCP} sockets to communicate with the sources allowing them to be written in any language that supports networking.
	\section{Challenges}
		\paragraph{}
			The largest challenge while creating this project was the constraints of the Arduino Uno. I had thought about switching to a different micro-controller but as I have a lot of experience with the Arduino I decided to find a solution that worked on it. After deciding to use the same shift register from the course's labs (74HC595) I had some difficulty finding some; most of the code was tested on a single shift register even though the project required a minimum of 9.
    \paragraph{}
      Once the shift registers had arrived and had been installed, my next challenge was getting the \gls{RGB} \glspl{LED} to work. \gls{RGB} \glspl{LED} require \gls{PWM} in order to display more than eight colors.
